# Vehicle owner insurance is issued to vehicle owners, but they only pay for all days the vehicle is NOT on rent by drivers
#                                                                          This is to cover periods the vehicle is waiting to be rented and sitting in the parking lot
#                                                                          Vehicle insurance pricing includes the end date (unlike driver insurance)
# eg. a vehicle insurance from 1st Oct to 8th Oct is 8 days of cover, at a rate of £1, gives a total of £8
# if the vehicle is rented from 2nd Oct to 5th Oct then the owner pays for 3 less days, giving a total of £5
